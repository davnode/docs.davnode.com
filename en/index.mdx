## What is Davnode?

Davnode is a no-nonsense hosting provider for **Email**, **Calendars** (CalDAV), and **Contacts** (CardDAV).

We built Davnode because we were tired of paying $6/month for every single email address we needed for our side projects. We believe that if you own the domain, you should be able to create as many mailboxes as you want without being penalized.

<Note>
  **Philosophy:** We move data from A to B. We don't scan your emails for ads,
  we don't train AI on your data, and we don't lock you into proprietary apps.
</Note>

## Why Davnode?

Most email providers are built for enterprise corporations. We are built for **developers, freelancers, agencies, small companies and single users**.

- **Flat Pricing:** One yearly fee. No "per-user" tax.
- **Unlimited Everything:** Create unlimited mailboxes and attach unlimited custom domains.
- **Standard Protocols:** Native support for IMAP, SMTP, CalDAV, and CardDAV.
- **Privacy First:** Your data is yours. Export it anytime via standard tools.
