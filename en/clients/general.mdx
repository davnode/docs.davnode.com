# Connect Davnode to Other Clients

If you are using an email client not covered in our specific guides (such as **Spark**, **Samsung Email**, **Airmail**, or **Evolution** on Linux), use the manual configuration settings below.

## Server Settings Reference (Cheat Sheet)

Most email clients will ask for an "Advanced" or "Manual" setup. Enter these values exactly as they appear.

### Incoming Mail (IMAP)

Recommended for syncing emails across multiple devices (phone, laptop, tablet).

| Setting                   | Value                                             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Server Hostname**       | `mail.davnode.com`                                |
| **Port**                  | `993`                                             |
| **Security / Encryption** | SSL / TLS                                         |
| **Username**              | Your full email address (e.g., `you@davnode.com`) |
| **Password**              | Your email password                               |

### Outgoing Mail (SMTP)

Required to send emails.

| Setting                   | Value                      |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| **Server Hostname**       | `mail.davnode.com`         |
| **Port**                  | `465`                      |
| **Security / Encryption** | SSL / TLS                  |
| **Authentication**        | Required (Normal Password) |
| **Username**              | Your full email address    |

If port `465` is blocked on your network, try port `8465` with **SSL/TLS** or port `587` with **STARTTLS**.

## Generic Setup Guide

While menus vary by app, the general process is almost always the same:

1.  **Add Account:** Look for "Settings" > "Accounts" > "Add Account".
2.  **Select Type:** Choose **IMAP** (sometimes listed as "Other" or "Internet Email").
    - _Avoid selecting POP3._
3.  **Enter Credentials:** Type your name, full email address, and password.
4.  **Manual Config:** If the app tries to auto-detect settings, look for a button that says **"Manual setup"**, **"Advanced settings"**, or **"Show details"**.
5.  **Input Server Details:** Copy the Hostname (`mail.davnode.com`) and Ports (`993` / `465`) from the reference table above.
6.  **Authenticate:** Ensure the "Outgoing Server requires authentication" box is checked.

<Note>
  We recommend to always use an **app password** for connecting mail clients.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Authentication Failed"

- **Username:** Ensure you are using your **full email address** as the username, not just the part before the `@`.
- **Hidden Spaces:** If copying and pasting, check that you didn't accidentally copy a blank space at the end of the password or hostname.

### "Connection Refused" or "Cannot Verify Server"

- **Port Mismatch:** Check that you selected **SSL/TLS** for port **465**.
  - If you selected **STARTTLS**, you must use port **587**.
  - _Davnode recommends Port 465 (SSL/TLS) for the best compatibility._

If port `465` is blocked on your network, try port `8465` with **SSL/TLS** or port `587` with **STARTTLS**.

### "Certificate Warning"

- If you see a warning about the certificate not matching, ensure the **Server Hostname** is set to `mail.davnode.com`.
