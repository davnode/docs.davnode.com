# Syncing with Android

Android does not support CalDAV or CardDAV protocols out of the box. To sync your Davnode data, you need to install a synchronization adapter app.

We recommend **DAVx⁵** (formerly DAVdroid), widely considered the best solution for Android.

## Server Settings

You will need these details during the setup:

| Service            | Server            | Port  | Encryption |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :---- | :--------- |
| **CalDAV/CardDAV** | `mail.davnode.me` | `443` | SSL/HTTPS  |

---

## 1. Install DAVx⁵

1. Download and install **DAVx⁵** from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.davdroid) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/).
2. Open the app and grant the necessary permissions (Contacts, Calendar, and Tasks).
   > _Note: For the best experience, also grant the "OpenTasks" permission if you plan to sync tasks._

## 2. Configure Account

<Note>
  We recommend to always use an **app password** for connecting calendars and
  contacts.
</Note>

1. Open DAVx⁵ and tap the **+ (Plus)** button (or "Add Account").
2. Select **Login with URL and user name**.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Base URL:** `https://mail.davnode.me/`
   - **User Name:** Your full Davnode email address.
   - **Password:** Your Davnode password.
4. Tap **Login**.
5. DAVx⁵ will connect to the server and discover your available address books and calendars.
6. **Create Account:**
   - Enter an account name (e.g., "Davnode").
   - Tap **Create account**.

## 3. Select Data to Sync

1. After creating the account, you will see a list of available collections.
2. **CardDAV:** Tap the **CardDAV** tab and check the box next to your address book.
3. **CalDAV:** Tap the **CalDAV** tab and check the boxes next to the calendars you want to sync.
4. Tap the **Sync** icon (refresh arrows) in the bottom right corner to perform the initial sync.

## 4. View Data in Android Apps

Once DAVx⁵ is synced, your data will appear in your native apps:

- **Contacts:** Open your default Contacts app. You should see "Davnode" (or the name you chose) listed under Accounts/Groups.
- **Calendar:** Open your default Calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar). Go to the sidebar menu and ensure the checkboxes for your Davnode calendars are ticked.

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Working Automatically

Android aggressively kills background processes to save battery. If contacts or calendars stop updating:

1. Open **DAVx⁵**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **App info**.
3. Ensure **Battery Optimization** is set to **Unrestricted** or "Don't Optimize" for DAVx⁵.

### "Certificate Not Trusted"

If you receive an SSL error:

1. Ensure the URL is entered correctly as `https://mail.davnode.me/`.
2. Ensure you are not behind a restrictive firewall or VPN blocking port 443.
