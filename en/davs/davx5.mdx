To sync Davnode on Android, we recommend using the **DAVx⁵** app. While you can purchase it on the Google Play Store to support the developers, it is also available for free via **F-Droid**, a catalog of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications.

This guide covers how to install F-Droid and then use it to install DAVx⁵.

## 1. Install F-Droid

If you already have F-Droid installed, skip to [Step 2](#2-install-davx5).

1. Open your web browser on your Android device (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Go to the official website: **[https://f-droid.org/](https://f-droid.org/)**
3. Tap the blue **Download F-Droid** button.
4. Once the `.apk` file finishes downloading, tap **Open**.
5. **Security Prompt:**
   - If your phone says _"For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source,"_ tap **Settings**.
   - Toggle **Allow from this source** to ON.
   - Tap the **Back** arrow to return to the installation screen.
6. Tap **Install**.
7. Once finished, tap **Open**.

## 2. Install DAVx⁵

1. Open the **F-Droid** app.
2. **Important:** Wait a moment for F-Droid to update its repositories. You will see a loading bar at the top or a spinner.
   > _If the repositories do not update, pull down on the screen to force a refresh._
3. Tap the **Search icon** (magnifying glass) in the bottom right corner.
4. Type `DAVx5` and search.
5. Tap on **DAVx⁵** (by bitfire web engineering).
6. Tap **Install**.
7. If prompted again for security permissions:
   - Tap **Settings**.
   - Allow F-Droid to install unknown apps.
   - Tap **Back** and tap **Install** again.

## 3. Next Steps

Now that you have DAVx⁵ installed, you need to connect it to your Davnode account.
